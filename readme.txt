== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require Elementor? =

No! While Elementor is fully supported, you can use any page builder or the default WordPress editor (Gutenberg or Classic Editor).

= Can I show different pages to different user roles? =

Yes! This is the core feature. You can assign a unique page to each user role.

= Will this work with my theme? =

Yes, the plugin embeds your page content in an iframe, so it works independently of your theme.
